          <h3>Our History</h3>
        </div>

        <br>

         <p>
           Rev. Muthuri Primary School is a product of their founders who dared to dream, back in 2013. This was a turbulent year, when the country was
           faced with the prospects of "new politics." Despite the uncertainty of the new politics, they believed that a new school would serve the
           country favourably. Thus the founders Phylis Muthuri, her two daughters Gacheri Muthoni and Gakii Muthuri and Josphat Mutua founded the school in Kanyakine, Kenya, among
           some of the country's best and oldest educational institutions. They sort to establish schools that will provide high quality education
           geared towards the holistic development of the child and comfort of the parent.
